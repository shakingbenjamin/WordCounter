Core 3 API with React SPA
How to run: 
First: 
open the api folder within vs code and in the terminal type 'dotnet run' and you should get results at https://localhost:5001/wordcounter 
Second: 
open the spa folder within vs code and in the terminal type 'npm start' and you should get the api results in a nicer screen at http://localhost:3000/

Assumptions: 
The url will be correct. 
That the url text would be the only text and is such hard coded T
hat the world is kind and won't try to hack/break it 
Char conversions would be permitted. 
That the delimiter would be sensible (when the option for the end user is available) 
The api will return expected values

With more time: 
removed node_modules but vs code had other ideas
To have allowed a url input and file upload options 
user chosen delimeter to re order the list itself 
to make the c# api async 
add filters 
add error handling
